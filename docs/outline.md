## About Us (include photos of ‘Cuse, the Daily Orange, and Angel Island)
### How we met
Joey and Rachel met in January 2007 while working at the school newspaper at Syracuse University, but didn’t start dating until three years later. Joey moved backed to CA only a few months later—and things didn’t look good—but after 2 years of trans-continental flights and long weekends, they decided to move to San Francisco together. They found a gorgeous rent-controlled apartment in the Richmond neighborhood near Sea Cliff with a great sushi restaurant and have been living there ever since.

### The Proposal
Rachel had all but given up hope—and had actually started looking for mangagement rings— when Joey proposed on May 11, 2014. He tested her first, making her climb to a campsite on the east side of Angel Island and then forcing her to sleep outdoors sans tent. The next day as the sun was rising over the Berkeley hills and the City glittered in the pink morning light, Joey “popped the question” and, of course, she said “yes.”

### The Wedding
Knowing that a majority of their friends and family would be flying in for the festivities, Joey and Rachel wanted to give their guests the quintessential wine country experience. To them this means good wine, good food, and good company. To that end they chose Quivira Vineyards as their setting, a biodynamic farm in the heart of Dry Creek Valley where they would let us dine amongst the vines and dance beneath the stars. local, organic food and florist???

## Meet the Wedding Party (need headshots)

### Maid of Honor
Stephanie Rivetz, Esq. -- Stephanie and Rachel met their freshman year at Syracuse University (at an extra credit lecture for their COM107 class given by some crazy woman from the National Enquirer). They exchanged numbers and became fast friends. In Fall 2006 while Rachel was abroad in London, she asked Steph to be her Facebook wife. Steph said yes and they have been social media married ever since :) Today Steph is an Associate at Orrick, Herrington, & Sutcliffe, LLP in New York City.

### Bridesmaids
Danielle Fus -- Danielle is Rachel’s entirely overeducated older sister. An English teacher at Whitman High School in Bethesda, MD, Danielle is currently working to earn her second master’s degree. Although to an outside observer they couldn’t be more different, the sisters have bonded over a mutual love of musicals, period dramas, and Talbots sweaters.

Konina Biswas -- Konina is possibly Joey’s oldest friend having met in just fourth grade after Joey moved to Saratoga from LA. Upon moving to SF, she and Rachel become friends as well, a relationship that was solidified when they all travelled to India together in Fall 2012. Currently, Nina is a UX Designer at Google.
